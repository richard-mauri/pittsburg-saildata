# Mauri's Weather & Water Conditions

A sailing-planning dashboard for the San Francisco Bay–Delta corridor and other supported waters. Select a sailing location to see nearby **observed wind**, **predicted tidal currents**, forecasts and environmental map overlays.

**Dashboard:** https://weather.themauris.org  
**Source:** https://github.com/richard-mauri/pittsburg-saildata

## Getting started

Open the dashboard, click the map where you want to sail, and generate conditions. Read the **Bottom Line** summary, then use **Conditions Now** and **Planning and Details** for observations, current timing, forecast context and overlays. You need not know NOAA station numbers: the application can select a nearby station with recent usable wind, or you can override it manually when you know a station is more representative.

Moving or zooming the map changes the view; **clicking a location** changes the selected sailing position. These actions are intentionally different.

## Understanding the data

**Wind** is measured at NOAA stations, including NDBC and selected validated NOAA CO-OPS sources. Review observation age, station identity, anemometer height and exposure.

**Current** is NOAA **tidal-current prediction**, not a direct measurement at your boat. Use the ebb, flood, slack, maximum-speed and time plots as planning context. Wind and current stations are selected separately.

**Forecasts and map layers** may include marine/point weather, radar, pressure, temperature, smoke/fire, wind barbs and swell depending on coverage and upstream availability. These are distinct from observations and tidal-current predictions.

## Main views and interfaces

- **Conditions Now:** concise current conditions and Bottom Line.
- **Planning and Details:** deeper wind, forecast and current-planning information.
- **Wind History:** observation plots/tables with 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 or 24-hour windows where data are available.
- **Station selection:** automatic nearby-usable choice or explicit manual override.
- **Maps:** environmental context and map overlays.

The Go service supports browser, text and JSON outputs where available. Documented routes include `/report`, `/planning`, `/wind-readings`, `/wind-stations`, `/point-weather` and `/marine-forecast`; parameters and formats depend on the endpoint.

## Operating limits

The documented public service is hosted by a locally running Go application exposed through Cloudflare Tunnel; the server and tunnel must be running for public access. Wind measurements may be delayed, stations may be unavailable, and predicted currents may differ from actual water movement.

**This is a planning and exploration tool, not a navigation or safety-critical instrument.** Use official forecasts, marine notices, charts, local knowledge and seamanship before sailing.
